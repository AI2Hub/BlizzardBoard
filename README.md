I'm using TSUtil.m from TrollStore to respring 

# Before proceeding read this

⚠️ Choosing the unstable version may cause a bootloop

The stable version may have some bugs but you shouldn't be able to bootloop with it

# Installation

There are 2 ipa options (The stable version is highly recommended)

[Stable](https://appinstallerios.com/TrollStoreIPAs/BlizzardBoard.ipa)

[Unstable](https://appinstallerios.com/TrollStoreIPAs/BlizzardBoard-Unstable.ipa)

Once you downloaded the ipa install it with TrollStore

# Why choose unstable?

Unstable has the ability to change the position of the theme icons to match the original app icon place on the Home Screen the stable version cannot

# What themes work?

Most snowboard themes should work with the stable build but the non stable build requires the icon naming scheme to be -large.png

# Adding Themes

To add themes just share the .theme to the BlizzBoard app or inside the BlizzBoard app tap import

# Setting Themes

Just tap enable on the theme you want to set at the bottom of my app you have some options like hiding the labels once you tap enable it might take a while depending on how many icons are in the theme **just don't exit the app during this process** once that's done you'll get a respring alert just tap respring now then you should have themed icons on your homescreen you'll have to rearrange them to match your needs
