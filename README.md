# BlizzardBoard

# Installation

There are 2 ipa options (The stable version is highly recommended)

[Stable](https://appinstallerios.com/TrollStoreIPAs/BlizzardBoard.ipa)

[Unstable](https://appinstallerios.com/TrollStoreIPAs/BlizzardBoard-Unstable.ipa)

Once you downloaded the ipa install it with TrollStore

# Why choose unstable?

Unstable has the ability to change the position of the theme icons to match the original app icon place on the Home Screen the stable version cannot

# What themes work?

Most snowboard themes should work with the stable build but the non stable build requires the icon naming scheme to be -large.png

# Adding Themes

To add themes just share the .theme to the BlizzBoard app or inside the BlizzBoard app tap import
